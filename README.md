 Visualizations Practiced

### 1. Column and Bar Charts
- **Stacked Column Chart:** Compared categories and showed part-to-whole relationships over time or across categories.
- **Clustered Column Chart:** Directly compared values between multiple categories.
- **Stacked Bar Chart:** Compared categories horizontally, useful for longer category names.

### 2. Pie and Donut Charts
- **Pie Chart:** Displayed the proportion of parts to a whole for a small number of categories.
- **Donut Chart:** Functionally similar to a pie chart but with a space in the center for a potential key metric.

### 3. Ribbon Chart
- Practiced using the Ribbon Chart to visualize data with a focus on ranking and how category rankings change over time.

### 4. Other Key Visualizations
- **Line Chart:** Showed trends over a continuous period (e.g., Time Series analysis).
- **Area Chart:** Emphasized the magnitude of change over time.
- **Table and Matrix:** Displayed detailed data and supported grouped data with drill-down capabilities.
- **Card & Multi-row Card:** Highlighted key performance indicators (KPIs) and important numbers.
- **Scatter Chart:** Explored the relationship between two numerical variables.

## Key Learnings
- **Chart Selection:** Understood which chart type is most effective for a specific analytical question (e.g., comparison, composition, distribution).
- **Formatting:** Mastered the Format pane to adjust colors, labels, titles, and legends for clarity and visual appeal.
- **Interactivity:** Explored how visuals cross-filter each other in a well-built report.

## How to Use This File
1. Open the `PowerBI_Visualization_Practice.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
2. Interact with the report pages to see the visuals in action.
3. Click on different elements to see cross-filtering and highlighting.

## Future Work
- Incorporate more advanced DAX formulas for calculated measures.
- Practice using custom visualizations from the AppSource.
- Add drill-through pages for detailed analysis.
- Integrate map visuals in a separate project.
